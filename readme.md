Welcome to my project for Unit 2!

This project tested our ability to reference DOM elements, create new html elements and manipulate them dynamically using pure Javascript, and use them in functions. This project uses those above things to create a web page that searches through an index of students. A maximum of ten students can be shown per page, and there should be a clear pagination field at the bottom. I am going for an "Exceeds Expectations" grade where for that I have added in a Search bar that searches for a student in real-time.

Thanks! Stephany
